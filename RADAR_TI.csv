Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG);Adopt;IA;FALSE;moved in;"<p><strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401v4"">Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</a></strong> is the preferred pattern for our teams to improve the quality of responses generated by a large language model (LLM). Weâ€™ve successfully used it in several projects, including the popular <a href=""https://www.jugalbandi.ai/mission"">Jugalbandi AI Platform</a>. With RAG, information about relevant and trustworthy documents â€” in formats like HTML and PDF â€” are stored in databases that supports a vector data type or efficient document search, such as <a href=""/radar/platforms/pgvector"">pgvector</a>, <a href=""/radar/platforms/qdrant"">Qdrant</a> or <a href=""/radar/platforms/elasticsearch-relevance-engine"">Elasticsearch Relevance Engine</a>. For a given prompt, the database is queried to retrieve relevant documents, which are then combined with the prompt to provide richer context to the LLM. This results in higher quality output and greatly reduced hallucinations. The context window â€” which determines the maximum size of the LLM input â€” is limited, which means that selecting the most relevant documents is crucial. We improve the relevancy of the content that is added to the prompt by reranking. Similarly, the documents are usually too large to calculate an embedding, which means they must be split into smaller chunks. This is often a difficult problem, and one approach is to have the chunks overlap to a certain extent.</p>"
Automatically generate Backstage entity descriptors;Trial;IA;TRUE;new;"<p><a href=""/radar/platforms/backstage"">Backstage</a> from Spotify has been widely adopted across our client base as the preferred platform to host developer experience portals. Backstage, on its own, is just a shell that hosts plugins and provides an interface to manage the catalog of assets that make up a platform ecosystem. Any entity to be displayed or managed by Backstage is configured in the catalog-info file, which contains data such as status, lifecycle, dependencies and APIs among other details. By default, individual entity descriptors are written by hand and usually maintained and versioned by the team responsible for the component in question. Keeping the descriptors up to date can be tedious and create a barrier to developer adoption. Also, there is always the possibility that changes are overlooked or that some components are missed entirely. We've found it more efficient and less error-prone to <strong>automatically generate Backstage entity descriptors</strong>. Most organizations have existing sources of information that can jump-start the process of populating catalog entries. Good development practices, for example, putting appropriate tags on AWS resources or adding metadata to source files, can simplify entity discovery and descriptor generation. These automated processes can then be run on a regular basis â€” once a day, for example â€” to keep the catalog fresh and up to date.</p>"
Combining traditional NLP with LLMs;Trial;IA;TRUE;new;<p>Large language models (LLMs) are the Swiss Army knives of natural language processing (NLP). But theyâ€™re also quite expensive and not always the best tool for the job â€” sometimes it's more effective to use a proper corkscrew. Indeed, thereâ€™s a lot of potential in <strong>combining traditional NLP with LLMs</strong>, or in building multiple NLP approaches in conjunction with LLMs to implement use cases and leverage LLMs for the steps where you actually need their capabilities. Traditional data science and NLP approaches for document clustering, topic identification and classification and even summarization are cheaper and can be more effective for solving a part of your use case problem. We then use LLMs when we need to generate and summarize longer texts, or combine multiple large documents, to take advantage of the LLM's superior attention span and memory. For example, weâ€™ve successfully used this combination of techniques to generate a comprehensive trends report for a domain from a large corpus of individual trend documents, using traditional clustering alongside the generative power of LLMs.</p>
Continuous compliance;Trial;IA;TRUE;new;"<p><strong>Continuous compliance</strong> is the practice of ensuring that software development processes and technologies comply with industry regulations and security standards on an ongoing basis, by heavily leveraging automation. Manually checking for security vulnerabilities and adhering to regulations can slow down development and introduce errors. As an alternative, organizations can automate compliance checks and audits. They can integrate tools into software development pipelines, allowing teams to detect and address compliance issues early in the development process. Codifying compliance rules and best practices helps enforce policies and standards consistently across teams. It enables you to scan code changes for vulnerabilities, enforce coding standards and track infrastructure configuration changes to ensure they meet compliance requirements. Lastly, automated reporting of the above simplifies audits and provides clear evidence of compliance. Weâ€™ve already talked about techniques like publishing <a href=""/radar/techniques/software-bill-of-materials"">SBOMs</a> and applying the recommendations from <a href=""/radar/techniques/slsa"">SLSA</a> â€” they can be very good starting points. The benefits of this technique are multifold. First, automation leads to more secure software by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities early and, second, development cycles accelerate as manual tasks are eliminated. Reduced costs and enhanced consistency are additional perks. For safety-critical industries like software-driven vehicles, automated continuous compliance can improve the efficiency and reliability of the certification process, ultimately leading to safer and more reliable vehicles on the road.</p>"
Edge functions;Trial;IA;TRUE;new;"<p>Although not a new concept, we've noticed the growing availability and use of decentralized code execution via content delivery networks (CDNs). Services such as <a href=""/radar/platforms/cloudflare-workers"">Cloudflare Workers</a> or <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/developer/application-security-performance/articles/cloudfront-edge-functions/"">Amazon CloudFront Edge Functions</a> provide a mechanism to execute snippets of serverless code close to the client's geographic location. <strong>Edge functions</strong> not only offer lower latency if a response can be generated at the edge, they also present an opportunity to rewrite requests and responses in a location-specific way on their way to and from the regional server. For example, you might rewrite a request URL to route to a specific server that has local data relevant to a field found in the request body. This approach is best suited to short, fast-running stateless processes since the computational power at the edge is limited.</p>"
Security champions;Trial;IA;TRUE;new;"<p><strong>Security champions</strong> are team members who think critically about security repercussions of both technical and nontechnical delivery decisions. They raise these questions and concerns with team leadership and have a firm understanding of basic security guidelines and requirements. They help development teams approach all activities during software delivery with a security mindset, thus reducing the overall security risks for the systems they develop. A security champion is not a separate position but a responsibility assigned to an existing member of the team who is guided by appropriate training from security practitioners. Equipped with this training, security champions improve the security awareness of the team by spreading knowledge and acting as a bridge between the development and security teams. One great example of an activity security champions can help drive within the team is <a href=""/radar/techniques/threat-modeling"">threat modeling</a>, which helps teams think about security risks from the start. Appointing and training a security champion on a team is a great first step, but relying solely on champions without proper commitment from leaders can lead to problems. Building a security mindset, in our experience, requires commitment from the entire team and managers.</p>"
Text to SQL;Trial;IA;TRUE;new;"<p><strong>Text to SQL</strong> is a technique that converts natural language queries into SQL queries that can be executed by a database. Although large language models (LLMs) can understand and transform natural language, creating accurate SQL for your own schema can be challenging. Enter <a href=""https://github.com/vanna-ai/vanna"">Vanna</a>, an open-source Python <a href=""/radar/techniques/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag"">retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</a> framework for SQL generation. Vanna works in two steps: first you create embeddings with the data definition language statements (DDLs) and sample SQLs for your schema, and then you ask questions in natural language. Although Vanna can work with any LLMs, we encourage you to assess <a href=""https://www.numbersstation.ai/post/introducing-nsql-open-source-sql-copilot-foundation-models"">NSQL</a>, a <a href=""/radar/techniques/domain-specific-llms"">domain-specific LLM</a> for text-to-SQL tasks.</p>"
Tracking health over debt;Trial;IA;FALSE;no change;"<p>We keep experiencing the improvements teams make to their ecosystem by treating the health rating the same as other service-level objectives (SLOs) and prioritizing enhancements accordingly, instead of solely focusing on tracking <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html"">technical debt</a>. By allocating resources efficiently to address the most impactful issues related to health, teams and organizations can reduce long-term maintenance costs and evolve products more efficiently. This approach also enhances communication between technical and nontechnical stakeholders, fostering a common understanding of the system's state. Although metrics may vary among organizations (see this <a href=""https://www.rea-group.com/about-us/news-and-insights/blog/what-good-software-looks-like-at-rea/"">blog post</a> for examples) they ultimately contribute to long-term sustainability and ensure software remains adaptable and competitive. In a rapidly changing digital landscape, focusing on <strong>tracking health over debt</strong> of systems provides a structured and evidence-based strategy to maintain and enhance them.</p>"
AI team assistants;Assess;IA;TRUE;new;"<p>AI coding assistance tools like <a href=""/radar/tools/github-copilot"">GitHub Copilot</a> are currently mostly talked about in the context of assisting and enhancing an individual's work. However, software delivery is and will remain team work, so you should be looking for ways to create <strong>AI team assistants</strong> to help create the ""10x team,"" as opposed to a bunch of siloed AI-assisted <a href=""/radar/techniques/10x-engineers"">10x engineers</a>. We've started using a team assistance approach that can increase knowledge amplification, upskilling and alignment through a combination of prompts and knowledge sources. Standardized prompts facilitate the use of agreed-upon best practices in the team context, such as techniques and templates for user story writing or the implementation of practices like threat modeling. In addition to prompts, knowledge sources made available through <a href=""/radar/techniques/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag"">retrieval-augmented generation</a> provide contextually relevant information from organizational guidelines or industry-specific knowledge bases. This approach gives team members access to the knowledge and resources they need just in time.</p>"
Graph analysis for LLM-backed chats;Assess;IA;TRUE;new;<p>Chatbots backed by large language models (LLMs) are gaining a lot of popularity right now, and weâ€™re seeing emerging techniques around productionizing and productizing them. One such productization challenge is understanding how users are conversing with a chatbot that is driven by something as generic as an LLM, where the conversation can go in many directions. Understanding the reality of conversation flows is crucial to improving the product and improving conversion rates. One technique to tackle this problem is to use <strong>graph analysis for LLM-backed chats</strong>. The agents that support a chat with a specific desired outcome â€” such as a shopping action or a successful resolution of a customer's problem â€” can usually be represented as a desired state machine. By loading all conversations into a graph, you can analyze actual patterns and look for discrepancies to the expected state machine. This helps find bugs and opportunities for product improvement.</p>
LLM-backed ChatOps;Assess;IA;TRUE;new;"<p><strong>LLM-backed ChatOps</strong> is an emerging application of large language models through a chat platform (primarily Slack) that allows engineers to build, deploy and operate software via natural language. This has the potential to streamline engineering workflows by enhancing the discoverability and user-friendliness of platform services. At the time of writing, two early examples are <a href=""https://www.promptops.com/devops/"">PromptOps</a> and <a href=""https://www.kubiya.ai/"">Kubiya</a>. However, considering the finesse needed for production environments, organizations should thoroughly evaluate these tools before allowing them anywhere near production.</p>"
LLM-powered autonomous agents;Assess;IA;FALSE;no change;"<p><strong>LLM-powered autonomous agents</strong> are evolving beyond single agents and static multi-agent systems with the emergence of frameworks like <a href=""https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/"">Autogen</a> and <a href=""https://www.crewai.io/"">CrewAI</a>. These frameworks allow users to define agents with specific roles, assign tasks and enable agents to collaborate on completing those tasks through delegation or conversation. Similar to single-agent systems that emerged earlier, such as <a href=""https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT"">AutoGPT</a>, individual agents can break down tasks, utilize preconfigured tools and request human input. Although still in the early stages of development, this area is developing rapidly and holds exciting potential for exploration.</p>"
Using GenAI to understand legacy codebases;Assess;IA;TRUE;new;"<p>Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) can help developers both write and understand code. In practical application, this is so far mostly limited to smaller code snippets, but more products and technology developments are emerging for <strong>using GenAI to understand legacy codebases</strong>. This is particularly useful in the case of  legacy codebases that arenâ€™t well-documented or where the documentation is outdated or misleading. For example, <a href=""https://www.driverai.com/"">Driver AI</a> or <a href=""https://bloop.ai/"">bloop</a> use  <a href=""/radar/techniques/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag"">RAG</a> approaches that combine language intelligence and code search with LLMs to help users find their way around a codebase. Emerging models with larger and larger context windows will also help to make these techniques more viable for sizable codebases. Another promising application of GenAI for legacy code is in the space of mainframe modernization, where bottlenecks often form around reverse engineers who need to understand the existing codebase and turn that understanding into requirements for the modernization project. Using GenAI to assist those reverse engineers can help them get their work done faster.</p>"
VISS;Assess;IA;TRUE;new;"<p>Zoom recently open-sourced its Vulnerability Impact Scoring System, or <strong><a href=""https://github.com/zoom/viss"">VISS</a></strong>. This system is mainly focused on vulnerability scoring that prioritizes actual demonstrated security measures. VISS differs from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) by not focusing on worst-case scenarios and attempting to more objectively measure the impact of vulnerabilities from a defender's perspective. To this aim, VISS provides a <a href=""https://viss.zoom.com/calculator/"">web-based UI</a> to calculate the vulnerability score based on several parameters â€” categorized into platform, infrastructure and data groups â€” including the impact on the platform, the number of tenants impacted, data impact and more. Although we don't have too much practical experience with this specific tool yet, we think this kind of priority-tailored assessment <a href=""https://viss.zoom.com/specifications"">approach</a> based on industry and context is worth practicing.</p>"
Broad integration tests;Hold;IA;TRUE;new;"<p>While we applaud a focus on automated testing, we continue to see numerous organizations over-invested in what we believe to be ineffective <strong>broad integration tests</strong>. As the term ""integration test"" is ambiguous, we've taken the broad classification from Martin Fowler's <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/bliki/IntegrationTest.html"">bliki entry</a> on the subject which indicates a test that requires live versions of all run-time dependencies. Such a test is obviously expensive, because it requires a full-featured test environment with all the necessary infrastructure, data and services. Managing the right versions of all those dependencies requires significant coordination overhead, which tends to slow down release cycles. Finally, the tests themselves are often fragile and unhelpful. For example, it takes effort to determine if a test failed because of the new code, mismatched version dependencies or the environment, and the error message rarely helps pinpoint the source of the error. Those criticisms don't mean that we take issue with automated ""black box"" integration testing in general, but we find a more helpful approach is one that balances the need for confidence with release frequency. This can be done in two stages by first validating the behavior of the system under test assuming a certain set of responses from run-time dependencies, and then validating those assumptions. The first stage uses service virtualization to create test doubles of run-time dependencies and validates the behavior of the system under test. This simplifies test data management concerns and allows for deterministic tests. The second stage uses <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContractTest.html"">contract tests</a> to validate those environmental assumptions with real dependencies.</p>"
Overenthusiastic LLM use;Hold;IA;TRUE;new;<p>In the rush to leverage the latest in AI, many organizations are quickly adopting large language models (LLMs) for a variety of applications, from content generation to complex decision-making processes. The allure of LLMs is undeniable
Rush to fine-tune LLMs;Hold;IA;TRUE;new;"<p>As organizations are looking for ways to make large language models (LLMs) work in the context of their product, domain or organizational knowledge, we're seeing a <strong>rush to fine-tune LLMs</strong>. While fine-tuning an LLM can be a powerful tool to gain more task-specificity for a use case, in many cases itâ€™s not needed. One of the most common cases of a misguided rush to fine-tuning is about making an LLM-backed application aware of specific knowledge and facts or an organization's codebases. In the vast majority of these cases, using a form of <a href=""/radar/techniques/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag"">retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</a> offers a better solution and a better cost-benefit ratio. Fine-tuning requires considerable computational resources and expertise and introduces even more challenges around sensitive and proprietary data than RAG. There is also a risk of underfitting, when you don't have enough data available for fine-tuning, or, less frequently, overfitting, when you have too much data and are therefore not hitting the right balance of task specificity that you need. Look closely at these trade-offs and consider the alternatives before you rush to fine-tune an LLM for your use case.</p>"
Web components for SSR web apps;Hold;IA;FALSE;no change;"<p>With the adoption of frameworks like <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/next-js"">Next.js</a> and <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/htmx"">htmx</a>, weâ€™re seeing more usage of server-side rendering (SSR). As a browser technology, it's not trivial to use <a href=""/radar/platforms/web-components-standard"">web components</a> on the server. Frameworks have sprung up to make this easier, sometimes even using a browser engine, but the complexity is still there. Our developers find themselves needing workarounds and extra effort to order front-end components and server-side components. Worse than the developer experience is the user experience: page load performance is impacted when custom web components have to be loaded and hydrated in the browser, and even with pre-rendering and careful tweaking of the component, a ""flash of unstyled content"" or some layout shifting is all but unavoidable. As mentioned in the previous Radar, one of our teams had to move their design system away from the web components-based <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/stencil"">Stencil</a> because of these issues. Recently, we received reports from another team that they ended up replacing server-sideâ€“generated components with browser-side components because of the development complexity. We caution against the use of <strong>web components for SSR web apps</strong>, even if supported by frameworks.</p>"
CloudEvents;Adopt;Segurança;FALSE;moved in;"<p>Events are common mechanisms in event-driven architecture or <a href=""/radar/techniques/serverless-architecture"">serverless</a> applications. However, producers or cloud providers tend to support them in different forms, which prevents interoperability across platforms and infrastructures. <strong><a href=""https://cloudevents.io/"">CloudEvents</a></strong> is a specification for describing event data in common formats to provide interoperability across services, platforms and systems. It provides SDKs in multiple languages so you can embed the spec into your application or toolchain. Our teams use it not only for cross-cloud platform purposes but also for domain event specification, among other scenarios. CloudEvents is hosted by the <a href=""https://www.cncf.io/"">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> (CNCF) and is now a graduated project. Our teams default to using CloudEvents for building event-driven architectures and for that reason weâ€™re moving it to Adopt.</p>"
Arm in the cloud;Trial;Segurança;FALSE;no change;"<p><a href=""https://www.arm.com/markets/computing-infrastructure/cloud-computing"">Arm compute instances in the cloud</a> have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their cost and energy efficiency compared to traditional x86-based instances. Many cloud providers now offer Arm-based instances, including <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/"">AWS</a>, <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-virtual-machines-with-ampere-altra-arm-based-processors-generally-available/"">Azure</a> and <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/tau-t2a-is-first-compute-engine-vm-on-an-arm-chip"">GCP</a>. The cost benefits of running <strong>Arm in the cloud</strong> can be particularly beneficial for businesses that run large workloads or need to scale. Weâ€™re seeing many teams of ours moving to Arm instances for workloads like JVM services and even databases (including RDS) without any change in the code and minimal changes in the build scripts. New cloud-based applications and systems increasingly default to Arm in the cloud. Based on our experiences, we recommend Arm compute instances for all workloads unless there are architecture-specific dependencies. The tooling to support multiple architectures, such as <a href=""https://www.docker.com/blog/multi-arch-build-and-images-the-simple-way/"">multi-arch Docker images</a>, also simplifies build and deploy workflows.</p>"
Azure Container Apps;Trial;Segurança;FALSE;moved in;"<p><strong><a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps"">Azure Container Apps</a></strong> is a managed <a href=""/radar/platforms/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a> application platform that streamlines the deployment of containerized workloads. In comparison to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the operational and administrative burden of running containerized applications is reduced, but this comes at the expense of some flexibility and control, which is a trade-off teams need to consider. Another product in this area, Azure Container Instances, is usually too limited for production use. Our teams started using Azure Container Apps last year, when it was still in public preview, with good results, even when running large containers. Now that it is generally available, weâ€™re considering it for more use cases.

The models can be adapted to tasks such as content generation, summarization, semantic search and translating natural language to code. Fine-tuning is also available via few-shot learning and the customization of hyperparameters. In comparison to OpenAI's own API, Azure OpenAI Service benefits from Azure's enterprise-grade security and compliance features, is available for more regions (although <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?regions=all&products=cognitive-services"">availability is limited</a> for each of the larger geographic regions) and supports private networking, content filtering and manual model version control.

DataHub;Trial;Segurança;FALSE;no change;"<p>When you build data products using <a href=""/radar/techniques/data-product-thinking-for-fair-data"">data product thinking</a>, it's essential to consider data lineage, data discoverability and data governance. Our teams have found that <strong><a href=""https://datahubproject.io/"">DataHub</a></strong> can provide particularly useful support here. Although earlier versions of DataHub required you to fork and manage the sync from the main product (if there was a need to update the metadata model), improvements in recent releases have introduced features that allow our teams to implement <a href=""https://datahubproject.io/docs/metadata-models-custom/#the-future"">custom metadata models</a> with a plugin-based architecture. Another useful feature of DataHub is the robust end-to-end data lineage from source to processing to consumption. DataHub supports both push-based integration as well as pull-based lineage extraction that automatically crawls the technical metadata across data sources, schedulers, orchestrators (scanning the Airflow DAG), processing pipeline tasks and dashboards, to name a few. As an open-source option for a holistic data catalog, DataHub is emerging as a default choice for our teams.</p>"
Infrastructure orchestration platforms;Trial;Segurança;TRUE;new;"<p>In-house infrastructure orchestration codebases frequently become a time sink to maintain and troubleshoot. <strong>Infrastructure orchestration platforms</strong> are appearing, promising to standardize and productize various aspects of infrastructure code delivery and deployment workflows.

Baichuan 2;Assess;Sistemas;TRUE;new;"<p><strong><a href=""https://github.com/baichuan-inc/Baichuan2/blob/main/README_EN.md"">Baichuan 2</a></strong> is part of a new generation of open-source large language models. It was trained on a high-quality corpus with 2.6 trillion tokens, achieving quite good performance for its size on Chinese, English and multi-language benchmarks. Baichuan has been trained on several domain-specific corpora, including healthcare and law data sets, which is why we prefer using it in these and related fields.</p>"
Cargo Lambda;Assess;Sistemas;TRUE;new;"<p>The efficiency and performance of <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/rust"">Rust</a> make it a good fit for serverless computing. Another advantage is that Rust functions donâ€™t require a run time, which results in fast startup times. However, the developer experience for writing the functions in Rust wasnâ€™t great. That changed with <strong><a href=""https://www.cargo-lambda.info/"">Cargo Lambda</a></strong>. As a cargo subcommand, it integrates with the typical Rust workflow and allows you to run and test your <a href=""/radar/platforms/aws-lambda"">AWS Lambda</a> functions on the developer machine without needing <a href=""/radar/platforms/docker"">Docker</a>, VMs or other tools. Using a <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/zig/"">Zig</a> toolchain, Cargo Lambda can cross-compile the functions on several operating systems for the Linux sandboxes used by AWS Lambda, and both Arm and Intel are supported as target architectures.</p>"
Codium AI;Assess;Sistemas;TRUE;new;"<p>In the busy emerging space of AI coding assistants, some products, instead of competing with the strong incumbents, take a more focused approach. <strong><a href=""https://www.codium.ai/"">Codium AI</a></strong> is focused on test generation with AI. It works for all languages but has advanced support for common stacks, such as JavaScript and Python. We particularly like that the tool, rather than taking developers straight to the test code, offers a list of scenario descriptions in natural language for review. This makes it easier for developers to reason about the scenarios and decide which ones to turn into test code. To further improve the test generation for a particular codebase and use case, users can provide example tests and general instructions to enhance the information used by the AI to generate the tests.</p>"
Continue;Assess;Sistemas;TRUE;new;"<p><strong><a href=""https://github.com/continuedev/continue"">Continue</a></strong> is an open-source autopilot for VS Code and JetBrains IDEs. We quite like it because it eliminates the pain of copying/pasting from a chat-based interface to large language models (LLMs) with a direct integration in the IDE. It supports several commercial and open-source <a href=""https://continue.dev/docs/model-setup/select-model"">models</a> and makes it easy to try different LLM <a href=""https://continue.dev/docs/model-setup/select-provider"">providers</a>, including <a href=""/radar/techniques/self-hosted-llms"">self-hosted LLMs</a>.

Fern Docs;Assess;Sistemas;TRUE;new;"<p>One hallmark of widely used REST APIs is that their contracts are thoroughly documented. Developers are more likely to adopt and use APIs whose behavior and syntax are described accurately in a structured, organized way. Keeping this documentation up to date as the contract evolves can be time-consuming and is a task that is easily overlooked. <strong><a href=""https://buildwithfern.com/#docs"">Fern Docs</a></strong> helps with this by reducing the toil involved in writing and maintaining API documentation. Fern automatically generates a website with attractive, usable documentation from a specification file that can be versioned alongside the API code. While our initial impressions of this product are positive, Fern does require you to maintain API information in a proprietary configuration file. While it provides a way to convert OpenAPI specs into its own configuration format, we'd prefer a tool that generates docs directly from annotated source code.</p>"
Granted;Assess;Sistemas;TRUE;new;"<p>Given how common multi-account strategy is in organizations' AWS environments, engineers frequently have to switch between multiple accounts within a short period of time. <strong><a href=""https://github.com/common-fate/granted"">Granted</a></strong>, a command-line tool that simplifies the opening of multiple accounts in the browser simultaneously, streamlines account switching. It leverages each browser's native features to isolate multiple identities, Firefox's <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/"">Multi-Account Containers</a> and <a href=""https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824"">Chromium's Profiles</a>. If a specific service (such as S3) is specified as an argument, Granted will open the service's landing page. Granted currently only supports AWS. Notably, it stores AWS SSO's temporary credentials safely in the keychain rather than as plain text on the disk.</p>"
LinearB;Assess;Sistemas;TRUE;new;"<p><strong><a href=""https://linearb.io/"">LinearB</a></strong> is a platform designed to empower engineering leaders with data-driven insights for continuous improvement. It tackles three key areas: benchmarking, workflow automation and investment. Our experience with LinearB's metrics tooling highlights its potential to support a culture of continuous improvement. One of our teams leveraged the platform to track engineering metrics, identify and discuss improvement opportunities and define actionable steps based on data, leading to measurable progress. We're happy to see that this aligns with LinearB's core value proposition: benchmark, automate and improve. LinearB integrates with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and Jira. It offers a comprehensive suite of preconfigured engineering metrics, with a strong focus on <a href=""/radar/techniques/four-key-metrics"">DORA metrics</a> (deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate and time to restore). As strong advocates of the four key metrics as defined by the DORA research, we appreciate LinearB's emphasis on measuring what truly matters for software delivery performance. Historically, gathering DORA-specific metrics has been a challenge. Teams have resorted to complex CD pipeline instrumentation, custom-built dashboards or rely on manual processes. Although our experience is limited to one team, LinearB seems to be a compelling alternative for gathering and tracking engineering metrics as well as fostering a data-driven approach to continuous improvement.</p>"
LLaVA;Assess;Sistemas;TRUE;new;"<p><strong><a href=""https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA"">LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant)</a></strong> is an open-source, large multimodal model that connects a vision encoder and LLM for general-purpose visual and language understanding.

Marimo;Assess;Sistemas;TRUE;new;"<p><strong><a href=""https://marimo.io/"">Marimo</a></strong> offers a fresh take on Python notebooks by prioritizing reproducibility and interactivity. It addresses challenges with hidden state in traditional notebooks (like <a href=""/radar/tools/jupyter"">Jupyter</a>) which can lead to unexpected behavior and hinder reproducibility. It does that by storing notebooks as plain Python files with no hidden state and using a deterministic execution order based on dependencies (when a variable changes, all affected cells are automatically run). Marimo also comes with interactive UI elements that similarly propagate value changes to cells that depend on them. As it can be deployed as a web app, itâ€™s also a useful tool for demos and prototyping purposes. Although weâ€™re excited for the potential of Marimo, in particular in terms of reproducibility for data exploration and analysis purposes, we continue to caution against <a href=""/radar/techniques/productionizing-notebooks"">productionizing notebooks</a>.</p>"
Mixtral;Assess;Sistemas;TRUE;new;"<p><strong><a href=""https://docs.mistral.ai/models/#mixtral-8x7b"">Mixtral</a></strong> is part of <a href=""https://docs.mistral.ai/models/"">the family of open-weight large language models</a> <a href=""https://mistral.ai/"">Mistral</a> released, that utilizes the <a href=""https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/"">sparse Mixture of Experts architecture</a>. The family of models are available both in raw pretrained and fine-tuned forms in 7B and 8x7B parameter sizes. Its sizes, open-weight nature, performance in benchmarks and context length of 32,000 tokens make it a compelling option for <a href=""/radar/techniques/self-hosted-llms"">self-hosted LLMs</a>. Note that these open-weight models are not tuned for safety out of the box, and users need to refine moderation based on their own use cases. We have experience with this family of models in developing <a href=""https://huggingface.co/opennyaiorg/Aalap-Mistral-7B-v0.1-bf16"">Aalap</a>, a fine-tuned Mistral 7B model trained on data related to specific Indian legal tasks, which has performed <a href=""https://huggingface.co/opennyaiorg/Aalap-Mistral-7B-v0.1-bf16#what-is-aalaps-intended-uses"">reasonably well</a> on an affordable cost basis.</p>"
NeMo Guardrails;Assess;Sistemas;TRUE;new;"<p><strong><a href=""https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails"">NeMo Guardrails</a></strong> is an easy-to-use open-source toolkit from NVIDIA that empowers developers to implement guardrails for large language models (LLMs) used in conversational applications. Although LLMs hold immense potential in building interactive experiences, their inherent limitations around factual accuracy, bias and potential misuse necessitate safeguards. Guardrails offer a promising approach to ensure responsible and trustworthy LLMs. Although you have a choice when it comes to LLM guardrails, our teams have found NeMo Guardrails particularly useful because it supports programmable rules and run-time integration and can be applied to existing LLM applications without extensive code modifications.</p>"
Ollama;Assess;Sistemas;TRUE;new;"<p><strong><a href=""https://github.com/ollama/ollama"">Ollama</a></strong> is an open-source tool for running and managing large language models (LLMs) on your local machine.

OpenTofu;Assess;Sistemas;TRUE;new;"<p><strong><a href=""https://opentofu.org/"">OpenTofu</a></strong> is a fork of <a href=""/radar/tools/terraform"">Terraform</a> made in response to a recent ambiguous license change by HashiCorp. It's open source and has been accepted by the Linux Foundation. It's backed by several organizations, including third-party vendors. The current version is compatible with the last open-source version of Terraform. Version 1.7 adds client-side encryption. The future of the OpenTofu project is unclear in terms of how closely it will support compatibility with future versions of Terraform. There are also questions around the long-term support by its current backers. We recommend keeping an eye on the project but remain cautious around usage, except for teams that have the capability to manage risks that may include being able to contribute to the codebase.</p>"
QAnything;Assess;Sistemas;TRUE;new;"<p>Large language models (LLMs) and <a href=""/radar/techniques/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag"">retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</a> techniques have greatly improved our ability to synthesize and extract information. Weâ€™re seeing emerging tools taking advantage of this, and <strong><a href=""https://github.com/netease-youdao/QAnything/tree/master"">QAnything</a></strong> is one of them. QAnything is a knowledge management engine with a question-and-answer interface that can summarize and extract information from a wide range of file formats, including PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX and MD files, among others. For data security concerns, QAnything also supports offline installation. Some of our teams use QAnything to build their team knowledge base. In GenAI scenarios with more industry depth (such as generating abstracts for investment reports), we also try to use this tool for proofs of concept before building real products and showing the potential of LLMs and RAG.</p>"
System Initiative;Assess;Sistemas;TRUE;new;"<p>Little has emerged in recent years to challenge the dominance of <a href=""/radar/tools/terraform"">Terraform</a> as an <a href=""/radar/techniques/infrastructure-as-code"">infrastructure coding</a> tool. Although alternatives such as <a href=""/radar/platforms/pulumi"">Pulumi</a>, <a href=""/radar/platforms/aws-cloud-development-kit"">CDK</a> and, more recently, <a href=""/radar/platforms/winglang"">Wing</a> have emerged, Terraform's modular, declarative paradigm has proven to be the most enduring. Indeed, all of these approaches share the common goal of modular code creating monolithic infrastructure. <strong><a href=""https://www.systeminit.com/"">System Initiative</a></strong> is a new, experimental tool that represents a radical new direction for DevOps work. One way to view System Initiative is as a digital twin for your infrastructure. Interactive changes to the System Initiative state result in corresponding change sets that can be applied to the infrastructure itself. Likewise, changes to the infrastructure are reflected in the System Initiative state. One of the great advantages of this approach is the collaborative environment it creates for things like application deployment and observability. Engineers interact with System Initiative through a user interface that has a graphical representation of the entire environment. In addition to managing the cloud infrastructure, you can also use the tool to manage containers, scripts, tools and more. Although we're generally skeptical of these kinds of GUI tools, System Initiative can be extended to handle new assets or enforce policy via TypeScript code. We really like the creative thinking that has gone into this tool and hope it will encourage others to break with the status quo of infrastructure-as-code approaches. System Initiative is free and open source under an Apache 2.0 license and is currently in open beta. The maintainers themselves do not recommend the tool for production use yet, but we think itâ€™s worth checking out in its current state to experience a completely different approach to DevOps tooling.</p>"
