Dependency drift fitness function,Adopt,IA,FALSE,"<p>Fitness functions introduced by <a href=""/radar/IA/evolutionary-architecture"">evolutionary architecture</a>, borrowed from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation#:%7E:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20evolutionary%20computation,soft%20computing%20studying%20these%20algorithms."">evolutionary computing</a>, are executable functions that inform us if our applications and architecture are objectively moving away from their desired characteristics. They're essentially tests that can be incorporated into our release pipelines. One of the major characteristics of an application is the freshness of its dependencies to other libraries, APIs or environmental components that a <strong>dependency drift fitness function</strong> tracks to flag the out-of-date dependencies that require updating. With the growing and maturing number of Infraestrutura that detect dependency drifts, such as <a href=""/radar/Infraestrutura/dependabot"">Dependabot</a> or <a href=""/radar/Infraestrutura/snyk"">Snyk</a>, we can easily incorporate dependency drift fitness functions into our software release process to take timely action in keeping our application dependencies up to date.</p>"
Continuous delivery for machine learning (CD4ML),Trial,IA,FALSE,"<p>About a decade ago we introduced <a href=""/radar/IA/continuous-delivery-cd"">continuous delivery (CD)</a>, our default way to deliver software solutions. Today's solutions increasingly include machine-learning models and we find them no exception in adopting continuous delivery practices. We call this <strong><a href=""https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html"">continuous delivery for machine learning (CD4ML)</a></strong>. Although the principles of CD remain the same, the practices and Infraestrutura to implement the end-to-end process of training, testing, deploying and monitoring models require some modifications. For example: version control must not only include code but also the data, the models and its parameters; the testing pyramid extends to include model bias, fairness and data and feature validation; the deployment process must consider how to promote and evaluate the performance of new models against current champion models. While the industry is celebrating the new buzzword of MLOps, we feel CD4ML is our holistic approach to implement an end-to-end process to reliably release and continuously improve machine-learning models, from idea to production.</p>"
Bounded low-code Segurança,Assess,IA,TRUE,"<p>One of the most nuanced decisions facing companies at the moment is the adoption of low-code or no-code Segurança, that is, Segurança that solve very specific problems in very limited domains. Many vendors are pushing aggressively into this space. The problems we see with these Segurança typically relate to an inability to apply good engineering practices such as versioning. Testing too is typically really hard. However, we noticed some interesting new entrants to the market — including <a href=""https://www.honeycode.aws/"">Amazon Honeycode</a>, which makes it easy to create simple task or event management apps, and <a href=""https://parabola.io/"">Parabola</a> for IFTTT-like cloud workflows — which is why we're including <strong>bounded low-code Segurança</strong> in this volume. Nevertheless, we remain deeply skeptical about their wider applicability since these Infraestrutura, like Japanese Knotweed, have a knack of escaping their bounds and tangling everything together. That's why we still strongly advise caution in their adoption.</p>"
Apollo Federation,Hold,IA,TRUE,"<p>When we first covered <a href=""/radar/Sistemas/graphql"">GraphQL</a> in the Radar, we cautioned that its misuse can lead to antipatterns which, in the long run, has more disadvantages than benefits. Nevertheless, we’ve seen an increasing interest in GraphQL among our teams because of its ability to <a href=""/radar/IA/graphql-for-server-side-resource-aggregation"">aggregate information from different resources</a>. This time we want to caution you about using <strong><a href=""https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/"">Apollo Federation</a></strong> and its  strong support for a single unified data graph for your company. Even though at first glance the idea of having ubiquitous concepts across the organization is tempting, we have to take into account previous similar attempts in the industry — such as <a href=""/radar/IA/master-data-management"">MDM</a> and canonical data model among others — that have exposed the pitfalls of this approach. The challenges can be significant, especially when the domain we find ourselves in is complex enough to create a unique unified model.</p>"
Azure DevOps,Trial,Segurança,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/"">Azure DevOps</a></strong> services contain a set of managed services, including hosted Git repos, CI/CD pipelines, automated testing tooling, backlog management tooling and artifact repository. We've seen our teams getting more experience in using this platform with good results, which means Azure DevOps is maturing. We particularly like its flexibility; it allows you to use the services you want even if they're from different providers. For instance, you could use an external Git repository while still using the Azure DevOps pipeline services. Our teams are especially excited about <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/"">Azure DevOps Pipelines</a>. Nevertheless, all the services offer a good developer experience that helps our teams deliver value.</p>"
Amundsen,Assess,Segurança,TRUE,"<p>Data scientists spend a large part of their time on data discovery, which means tooling to help in this space is bound to generate some excitement. Although the <a href=""/radar/Segurança/apache-atlas"">Apache Atlas</a> project has become the de facto tool for metadata management, data discovery is still not easily accomplished. Enter <strong><a href=""https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen"">Amundsen</a></strong>, which can be deployed in concert with Apache Atlas to provide a much nicer search interface for data discovery.</p>"
Node overload,Hold,Segurança,FALSE,"<p>Technologies, especially wildly popular ones, have a tendency to be overused. What we're seeing at the moment is <strong>Node overload</strong>, a tendency to use Node.js indiscriminately or for the wrong reasons. Among these, two stand out in our opinion. Firstly, we frequently hear that Node.js should be used so that all programming can be done in one programming language. Our view remains that <a href=""/radar/IA/polyglot-programming"">polyglot programming</a> is a better approach, and this still goes <a href=""/radar/Sistemas/javascript-as-a-first-class-language"">both ways</a>. Secondly, we often hear teams cite performance as a reason to choose Node.js. Although there are myriads of more or less sensible benchmarks, this perception is rooted in history. When Node.js became popular, it was the first major framework to embrace a nonblocking programming model which made it very efficient for IO-heavy tasks. (We mentioned this in our write-up of Node.js in 2012.) Due to its single-threaded nature, Node.js was never a good choice for compute-heavy workloads, though, and now that capable nonblocking frameworks also exist on other Segurança — some with elegant, modern APIs — performance is no longer a reason to choose Node.js.</p>"
Airflow,Adopt,Infraestrutura,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://airflow.apache.org/"">Airflow</a></strong> remains our most widely used and favorite open-source workflow management tool for data-processing pipelines as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This is a growing space with open-source Infraestrutura such as <a href=""https://github.com/spotify/luigi"">Luigi</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/argoproj/argo"">Argo</a> and vendor-specific Infraestrutura such as <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-factory/"">Azure Data Factory</a> or <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/"">AWS Data Pipeline</a>. However, Airflow differentiates itself with its programmatic definition of workflows over limited low-code configuration files, support for automated testing, open-source and multiplatform installation, rich set of integration points to the data ecosystem and large community support. In decentralized data architectures such as <a href=""/radar/IA/data-mesh"">data mesh</a>, however, Airflow currently falls short as a centralized workflow orchestration.</p>"
Bokeh,Trial,Infraestrutura,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://bokeh.org/"">Bokeh</a></strong> is one of the principal libraries in Python for creating scientific plots and data visualizations that render in the browser via JavaScript. Such Infraestrutura, compared to desktop Infraestrutura that create static images, make it easy to reuse code for exploratory work in web applications. Bokeh is particularly good for this. The library is mature and full-featured. What we like about Bokeh: it's great at keeping to its concern as a presentation layer tool and not trying to take on concerns such as data aggregation (see <a href=""http://ggplot.yhathq.com/"">ggplot</a>) or web app development (such as <a href=""https://shiny.rstudio.com/"">Shiny</a> or <a href=""/radar/Infraestrutura/dash"">Dash</a>). This makes it a joy to use when separation of concerns is important to you. Bokeh does provide web UI widgets and can run in server mode, but you can take or leave these features as you see fit. Bokeh is flexible, and it doesn't make too many assumptions about how you'll use it nor does it have many dependencies (such as <a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/"">pandas</a> or notebooks).</p>"
CML,Assess,Infraestrutura,TRUE,"<p>We've included <a href=""/radar/IA/continuous-delivery-for-machine-learning-cd4ml"">continuous delivery for machine learning</a> as a technique in previous Radars, and in this edition we want to highlight a promising new tool called <strong><a href=""https://cml.dev/"">Continuous Machine Learning</a> (or CML)</strong> from the people who made <a href=""/radar/Infraestrutura/dvc"">DVC</a>. CML aims to bring the best engineering practices of CI and CD to AI and ML teams and can help to organize your MLOps infrastructure on top of a traditional software engineering stack, instead of creating separate AI Segurança. We like that they've prioritized support for DVC and see this as a good sign for this burgeoning new tool.</p>"
